    <h1>Creamy Avocado Sauce Recipe</h1>
   	
   	<p>Creamy, thick, and rich with lots of garlic flavour and a hint of lemon. This is my newest favourite pasta dish. The avocado works wonderfully in this recipe to create a sauce so creamy and thick, you will think there is cream hiding in there</p>

	<uo>
  	 	<li>1 to 2 cloves garlic, to taste</li>
		<li>1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, plus more for serving</li>
		<li>1-2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, to taste</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more if needed</li>
		<li>1 ripe medium avocado, pitted</li>
		<li>1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon (1 to 2 mL) fine-grain sea salt, to taste</li>
		<li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
		<li>Lemon zest, for serving</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Directions</p>

   	<ol>
		<li>PBring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta according to the instructions on the package. For a lighter option, serve the avocado sauce with <a href="recipe_main.html">roasted spaghetti squash noodles.</a></li>

		<br>
		
		<li>While the pasta cooks, make the sauce: In a food processor, combine the garlic and basil and pulse to mince.</li>

		<br>

		<li>Add the lemon juice, oil, avocado flesh, and 1 tablespoon water and process until smooth, stopping to scrape down the bowl as needed. If the sauce is too thick, add a bit more oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>

		<br>

		<li>Drain the pasta and place it back in the pot. Add the avocado sauce and stir until combined. You can gently rewarm the pasta if it has cooled slightly, or simply serve it at room temperature.</li>

		<br>

		<li>Top with lemon zest, pepper, and fresh basil leaves, if desired.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Tips: Because avocados oxidize quickly after you slice them, this sauce is best served immediately. If you do have leftover sauce, transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 1 day.</p>
