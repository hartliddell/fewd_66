        <h1>Who: AFS Intercultural Programs</h1>
        <p>AFS Intercultural Programs is an international, voluntary, non-governmental, non-profit organization that provides intercultural learning opportunities to help people develop the knowledge, skills and understanding needed to create a more just and peaceful world.</p>
        <h1>What?</h1>
        <p>A "country page" to promote our intercultural exchange destinations. It should be easily adapted to multiple destinations, but for the purpose of this class I will work specifically on Malaysia, where our 2015 Network Meeting will be taking place.</p>
        <p>The site should be fully responsive. To make the site feel more "alive",I want to include animations, reactive behaviours, etc..</p>
        <h1>Why?</h1>
        <p>AFS is launching a new campaign to promote our exhange programs, and our site is in dire need of an update. As rolling out a whole new site for 60+ partners will take a while longer. This will also be a pilot for our new site re-design coming in 2016.</p>
