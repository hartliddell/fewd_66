      <p>Experience the magic of Malaysia—a rich collage of cultures, modern buildings next to traditional spice markets, and rainforests teeming with rare and endangered species.</p>
      <p>Few places in Asia can provide a comparable mix of cultures, traditions, languages, religions, and cuisines. </p>
      <p>Native Malays share citizenship with ethnic Chinese and Indians, and though the state religion is Islam, Buddhist shrines and Hindu temples are as commonplace as Islamic mosques. This diversity is celebrated throughout the year with many different
        multicultural festivals.</p>

        <p>In Malaysia, you will be living with a Host Family, you might have younger or older siblings and you will become a new member of the family, it is this integration, that makes the AFS experience so unique. Like all AFS host families worldwide,
          they are not paid. They open their homes to students in order to share their community and culture as well as to enrich their own family lives. </p>
        <p>Extended families often live together. Elders are highly regarded and respected. Malaysians have a relaxed attitude about time and punctuality.</p>
        <p>Parents are protective of their children and like to know your friends and where you are going to be at all times. Bedrooms are not private; family members can enter at all times.</p>
        <p>The variety of people in Malaysia makes for a very interesting mix of cuisine—spicy Malay dishes, an endless variety of Chinese food, exotic cuisine from North and South India, as well as local Nyonya and Portuguese dishes. Western cuisine is
          also easily accessible, and there are many international fast-food chains. Traditional Malay food resembles Indonesian and Indian cooking; most dishes are characterized by the liberal addition of spices, chilies and coconut cream. Fish is made
          for any occasion and in many styles.</p>
        <p>Meals are important family time, which offer great opportunities to get to know your host family. Food on the table is shared by all the family. It is proper etiquette not to finish everything, and to break and eat a small piece at a time.</p>

      <section class="content">
        <p>Learn first-hand about Malaysian lifestyle by attending a local high school and living with a host family. Because of the religious and cultural diversity of the country, as an AFSer in Malaysia you will be introduced to a vast array of lifestyles
          and customs.
        </p>
        <p>You'll return home with stories of a Chinese New Year among paper lanterns, Hari Raya among miles of delicious foods, and Diwali among millions of candles.</p>
        <p>Malaysian diversity is very complex with many layers. Compared to many other cultures Malaysian culture would be considered more collectivist based on Geert Hofstede's Dimensions of National Cultures theory.</p>
        <p>Collectivist societies tend to value the good of the whole as more important than the good of the individual: “One generation plants the trees and another gets the shade.” Whether it is their ethnic group, religious affiliation, or family, Malaysian’s
          sense of group affiliation is deep rooted. Click here to find out more.</p>

        <p>While you could be placed anywhere in Malaysia, most students are placed in urban or suburban areas. AFS will offer you the opportunity to see different places and cultures in Malaysia by placing you with another host family for two to three weeks
          during the latter part of your stay.</p>
        <p>In Malaysia, you will have have opportunities to visit spice markets and learn about local activities like sepak takraw (a kickball type of volleyball), giant top spinning, and kite-flying, and enjoy multicultural festivals celebrated throughout
          the year.</p>
